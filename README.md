# Jabroney
JavaScript Snake-Like Game

## Status
I'm no longer working on this. I learned a great deal from this game about code infrastructure, graphical layout, and basic design principles. I'll be carrying this forward onto a bigger, better project using what I've learned here as a stepping stone.

### Goal of Jabroney
You are a computer techie and you've come to clean up your customer's computer. It's probably a mess. There are virii, Trojan horses, bad files, and memory leaks to take care of. Lucky for you, you're a master tech expert. Clean up the files before the virus eats the computer in half.

### Key takeaways from this project
Plan everything before writing a single line of code. If you can't do it in psuedo code, it's not going to work well when it comes down to making it function smoothly overall

If absolutely any code is repeated, it can be written better

Use GIT! It is tricky to learn up front, but makes working/updating/developing a LOT easier, especially if collaborating on a project
